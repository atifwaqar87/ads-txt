## The Need for Live TV, Wherever You Are

When you live outside Pakistan, you realize how much of your daily rhythm used to revolve around local news — especially on TV. The 9 PM bulletin, the tickers, the press conferences, the political talk shows — love them or hate them, they were part of our daily lives.

I’m Atif, and like many Pakistanis abroad, I now live in Sweden. While it’s a beautiful place, nothing here comes close to the emotional chaos of a live news broadcast from Pakistan. The anchors arguing, the breaking news banners flashing every few minutes, and yes, even the occasional “breaking” that isn’t really breaking — it all hits differently.

## Why Live TV Still Matters

Even in the age of social media and YouTube, **live news coverage has its own charm** — and its own importance. Whether it’s election night, a major court decision, or a sudden political twist, *live TV gives you the full picture as it unfolds*, not just the edited version.

But watching Pakistani TV channels abroad is harder than it should be. You either:

- Get stuck searching random websites  
- Click shady pop-ups  
- Land on pages that don’t even work anymore

It’s frustrating — especially when all you want is to quickly catch up on what’s happening back home.

## So I Built a Simple Solution

Since I was already building [PakStream](https://www.pakstream.com) to stream Pakistani FM radio and curate reliable YouTube journalists, I figured — why not add **live TV channels** too?

Just like the radio and YouTube sections, I wanted this to be:

- **Clean**  
- **Ad-free**  
- **One-click easy**  

No spammy redirects. No broken players. Just working links to the **most popular Pakistani news channels**, all in one place.

## These Are My Go-To Channels

Right now, the live TV section includes the channels I personally check most often:

- Geo News  
- ARY News  
- Express News  
- BOL News  
- GNN  
- SAMAA TV  
- 24 News  
- PTV News  
- HUM News  
- Dunya News  
- 92 News  

Each one opens in a separate, mobile-friendly player — so whether you’re at work, on your commute, or chilling at home, you’re just one click away from the headlines.

## Built for People Like Us

PakStream is not backed by sponsors, media houses, or advertisers. It’s just something I built to **stay connected to Pakistan in a real, meaningful way**.

I know many of you feel the same — whether you’re in Europe, the Middle East, North America, or anywhere else. We want to stay informed, but we don’t want the headache of chasing working links every time there's breaking news.

This site is for all of us — the overseas Pakistanis who miss the noise, the drama, and the reality of what’s happening back home.

## Suggest a Channel — Let’s Build This Together

If there’s a Pakistani TV channel you watch that isn’t listed yet, **let me know in the comments**. I’d love to add it to PakStream so that others can benefit too.

This is a community-driven project. The more we collaborate, the better the experience becomes for everyone.

## Final Words

PakStream started as a personal project, but it’s quickly turning into something bigger — a small digital corner for Pakistanis abroad. First radio, then YouTubers, and now live TV — and there’s more to come.

So go ahead. Bookmark it. Share it. Use it during your morning chai or your late-night news scroll.

Let’s keep the connection alive — one click at a time.
