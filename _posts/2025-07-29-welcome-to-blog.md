## Assalamualaikum and Welcome! 🇵🇰

If you’ve somehow landed here, then first of all — **thank you**. This little blog is part of a bigger journey I’ve been on, and I’m truly glad you’re here.

My name is Atif. I’m a software developer based in Sweden, but in my heart and roots — I’ll always be a Pakistani. That connection never fades. No matter where life takes us, there’s something about Pakistan that stays within us. The sounds, the food, the language, the humor, the chaos — it's all home.

## Why This Blog Exists

I created PakStream as a simple tool for myself. I just wanted a clean way to listen to Pakistani radio, catch up on local news, and follow my favorite YouTubers without jumping through broken links or pop-up nightmares.

But then something clicked:  
**Maybe I’m not the only one who misses this stuff.**

That’s when I decided to open it up, and this blog is my way of telling that story — of sharing how this project started, where it's going, and most importantly, hearing from *you*.  

This isn’t just a blog about tech or media. It’s about **belonging**. It’s for people like me (and maybe you), who want to stay connected to Pakistan in some small but meaningful way.

## Built with Vibes, Not Just Code

I won’t lie — this entire website is a product of what I call *“vibe coding”*. No corporate planning, no deadlines — just me, late at night, with chai, lo-fi music, and an itch to build something that felt real. That kind of coding where you lose track of time, because you're building something that matters to *you*.

It’s not perfect. But it’s honest. And built with love.

## What to Expect Here

In this blog, I’ll be sharing:

- The story behind PakStream and how it started  
- New features and updates as I add them  
- Blog posts about nostalgia, culture, and life abroad  
- Recommendations — radio stations, YouTubers, TV channels  
- Messages from users like you who share feedback and ideas

It’s also a space to **connect with like-minded Pakistanis abroad**. If you relate to any of this, drop a comment, say hello, or share a suggestion. I genuinely read them all — and many of the features on the site are inspired by conversations I’ve had with people just like you.

## Let’s Build Something Together

I may be running this solo, but I don’t want to build it alone.

So if you have a cool idea, or a favorite radio station, or a journalist you trust — let me know. PakStream is for all of us, and the best part is: it’s always growing.

Thanks again for stopping by. I hope you find something here that makes your day better — even if it’s just hearing a familiar voice from back home.

**Once a Pakistani, always a Pakistani.** 🇵🇰  
No matter where we go, the roots stay strong.

– *Atif*
