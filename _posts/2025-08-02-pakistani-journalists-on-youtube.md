Gone are the days when you had to wait for the 9 PM bulletin to hear the truth. In 2025, **Pakistani journalists are making waves — not in studios, but on YouTube**.

They’re bold, unfiltered, and most importantly, **free from corporate influence**. If you’re an overseas Pakistani tired of one-sided news, this is your golden era.

### 🎙️ Why Are Journalists Shifting to YouTube?

The reasons are simple:
- **Freedom of speech** – Say what you want without pressure from channel owners.
- **Direct audience connection** – No producers or editors between you and your viewers.
- **Monetization** – YouTube pays well, especially with large overseas audiences.
- **Censorship avoidance** – Some stories are too “hot” for mainstream TV.
