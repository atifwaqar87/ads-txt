Before TikTok, before YouTube, even before television — **there was radio**. For decades, **Radio Pakistan** wasn’t just a medium of entertainment or news; it was the voice of the nation.

From independence in 1947 till the digital age, **Pakistani radio played a huge role in shaping our national identity**, connecting citizens across cities, villages, and borders — and giving Pakistanis a sense of unity.

Let’s take a look at how radio built the emotional, cultural, and political tone of Pakistan long before Wi-Fi and social media.

### 📻 1. **Radio Pakistan: The Nation’s First Voice**

- Launched on **August 14, 1947**, just hours after independence  
- Announced the creation of Pakistan in both Urdu and English  
- Became the primary source for national announcements, speeches, and public messaging

Famous opening line:  
*"Yeh Radio Pakistan hai..."*  
That voice still echoes in every Pakistani’s memory.

### 🎙️ 2. **Connecting the Unconnected**

In the 1950s–80s:
- Radio was the only mass medium accessible in **remote villages**  
- People would gather around one radio in the mohallah  
- Farmers listened during work; shopkeepers tuned in during slow hours

It helped bridge **linguistic, cultural, and geographic divides** — something no other platform could do back then.

### 📰 3. **Trusted Source of News**

Before TV or newspapers became common:
- People waited for the *9 AM and 8 PM news bulletins*  
- Radio was used during wars (especially in 1965 and 1971) for updates and morale-boosting messages  
- Speeches by leaders like **Quaid-e-Azam**, **Liaquat Ali Khan**, and **Zulfikar Ali Bhutto** were broadcast nationwide

In many homes, people would **stand up during the national anthem on radio** — that’s how sacred it felt.

Radio Pakistan nurtured:
- Urdu poetry (with live mushairas)
