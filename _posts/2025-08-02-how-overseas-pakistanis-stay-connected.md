Whether you're living in London, Toronto, Dubai, or Stockholm — one thing all overseas Pakistanis have in common is this: **we miss home**.

The language, the street food, the late-night chai sittings, and yes — the *"kya hal hai?"* from random shopkeepers. But thanks to the internet and some clever desi habits, **staying connected to Pakistan is easier than ever.**

### 📱 1. **WhatsApp Groups with Family**

Every Pakistani expat is part of at least one **family WhatsApp group** where:

- Mamu shares morning duas  
- Khala sends political memes  
- Someone always drops a wedding picture  
- And random "Good Morning" flowers are guaranteed 🌸

Love it or hate it — this is your daily lifeline to home.

### 📺 2. **Watching Pakistani TV & Dramas**

Pakistani dramas and talk shows are a major way to feel the *desi vibe*. Whether it's *Hum TV*, *Geo*, *ARY*, or even old PTV classics — they're all just one YouTube search away.

👉 Try platforms like [PakStream](https://neurolingo.cc/pakstream) to stream live news and TV.

### 📰 4. **Following Desi YouTubers & Journalists**

Many overseas Pakistanis get their news from YouTube now. Journalists like **Imran Riaz Khan**, **Moeed Pirzada**, and **Mansoor Ali Khan** give unfiltered updates with desi flair.

It feels less like news — more like a cousin giving you a scoop from Lahore.

### 🕌 5. **Watching Ramzan Transmissions & Live Naats**

Ramzan away from Pakistan can feel empty — but live transmissions, Quran recitations, and Naat sharif programs help bring that spiritual vibe back.

Channels like **Madani Channel**, **PTV**, and **Saut-ul-Quran** are gold during religious months.

### 🍛 6. **Craving Home? Cook It.**

YouTube is full of Pakistani recipe channels now — from *dhaba-style chai* to *mutton karahi*. Cooking desi food isn’t just about taste — it brings **memories, emotions, and stories** to life.

From Shan masalas to Pakola to Eid joras — you can now order desi stuff online in most countries. Sites like:
- *Pakistan Store UK*

- *Amazon Global* (for some items)

Let’s be honest — the day you find National Achaar in a foreign supermarket is the day you *feel rich* 😄
