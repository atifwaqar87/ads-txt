## Life Away from the Homeland

There’s something about the streets of Pakistan — the noisy honks, the colorful rickshaws, the echo of the azaan drifting through the air, and the FM radio stations playing both old melodies and political rants. These aren’t just background noises. They are the sounds of home.

My name is Abid, and like many Pakistanis, I live abroad. Sweden has been home for a few years now. It’s a beautiful country — peaceful, organized, and scenic — but let’s be honest, nothing replaces the raw, vibrant energy of Pakistan. The longer you stay away, the more you begin to miss the little things.

I found myself missing things I never thought I would: the frustrating Karachi traffic, the occasional “light chali gayi” updates, and above all — Pakistani radio.

## The Craving for Local Radio

It started out of nowhere. I was driving to work one morning in Sweden, and I remembered how back in Pakistan, I would always have FM 91 or City FM 89 playing in the background. Whether it was a lively morning show or a soulful song from the 90s, radio made the traffic bearable. It made me feel connected to the city and its pulse.

So I did what any tech-savvy expat would do — I searched online for “Pakistani radio online.” And to my surprise, many Pakistani FM stations actually had online streams. You could listen to them from anywhere in the world. That was a game changer.

I started bookmarking links, saving them here and there, trying different websites. But most of them were either outdated, full of broken links, or cluttered with annoying pop-ups. The user experience was terrible. That’s when the idea hit me.

## From Need to Creation

Being a software developer, I decided to create something simple for myself — a clean, ad-free webpage with a few of my favorite radio stations, available with one click. No distractions. Just the content I love from back home.

I named it **PakStream** — short for “Pakistan Stream” — and it quickly became a small comfort in my daily routine. I’d turn it on while working, cooking, or driving. It made me feel closer to home in a way Netflix never could.

After a few weeks, I shared the site with a friend who’s also living abroad. He tried it and immediately said, “Yaar, this is brilliant! Why don’t you make it public for others like us?” That’s when I realized — I’m probably not the only one who misses Pakistani radio.

## Introducing PakStream.com

So I bought the domain [www.pakstream.com](https://www.pakstream.com) and made it live for everyone. The goal is simple: **to give overseas Pakistanis a small window into their homeland.** Whether you're in London, Dubai, Toronto, or Oslo — you should be able to tune into a Pakistani FM station with ease.

Currently, the site hosts a few of my personal favorites:

- City FM 89  
- FM 100 Pakistan  
- Mast FM 103  
- Power99  
- Apna Karachi FM 107

Each radio station opens in a clean, mobile-friendly player. No ads, no unnecessary clutter — just radio.

Over time, I plan to add more — including regional stations from Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and even Gilgit-Baltistan. I also want to expand into TV news channels and popular political YouTubers, so it truly becomes a one-stop platform for Pakistani media abroad.

## A Community-Driven Project

One of the most important things I want to mention is this: **PakStream is not just for me anymore — it’s for all of us.** If you’re a Pakistani living abroad and have a favorite FM station that’s not listed, please let me know in the comments section of this blog. I’d be more than happy to add it for everyone’s benefit.

This project is not backed by any organization. There’s no team or funding behind it. It’s just me — a homesick Pakistani developer trying to make something meaningful for people like me.

## Why Radio Still Matters

You might be wondering: “In the age of Spotify and YouTube, who even listens to radio anymore?”

But here’s the thing — radio is different.

Radio is **live**. It’s **local**. It reflects the **mood of the city**, the **pulse of the people**. A Spotify playlist won’t tell you about a roadblock on Shahrah-e-Faisal or the result of a cricket match. A YouTube video won’t give you a spontaneous caller requesting a ghazal for their wife’s birthday.

Radio is human. It connects you in real time to the place you love and miss.

## Building for the Diaspora

There are millions of Pakistanis living outside Pakistan — working, studying, or raising families abroad. Many of us still have emotional ties to the culture, language, and energy of our homeland. We celebrate Eid on Skype, send money through remittance apps, and try to teach our kids Urdu through cartoons.

PakStream is my small contribution to this community — to remind us that no matter how far we go, we’re still connected to Pakistan. Not through grand gestures, but through small experiences — like tuning into your favorite RJ’s voice while making daal chawal in a cold European kitchen.

## What’s Next for PakStream

This is just the beginning. Here’s what I’m planning next:

- **More Radio Stations** – including regional and niche ones  
- **Live TV Channels** – so you can watch Geo, ARY, or PTV directly  
- **Political Commentary** – from popular YouTubers and journalists  
- **Blog Posts** – sharing stories like this one, contributed by fellow Pakistanis abroad  
- **User Suggestions Section** – so you can tell me what else you want added

If the site grows and people find value in it, I may even consider adding native mobile apps or features like saving your favorite stations, scheduling reminders for programs, and more.

## Let’s Keep Pakistan Close, No Matter Where We Are

This blog is not just a launch note — it’s an invitation. If you're living away from Pakistan and miss even a fraction of what I’ve described here, visit [www.pakstream.com](https://www.pakstream.com). Try it. Tune in. Feel the warmth.

And if you like it — share it. With friends, family, and colleagues who might be looking for a slice of home. Let’s build something meaningful together.

Thanks for reading — and thanks for being part of this digital little Pakistan. 🇵🇰
